// Package event defines the typed event stream the agent emits as it runs a
// turn, and the Sink it emits to. It decouples "what happened" (the model
// produced reasoning, a tool was dispatched, a turn used N tokens) from "how to
// show it" (ANSI scrollback in a terminal, a card in a webview).
//
// The agent depends only on Sink; each frontend implements one. The chat TUI
// renders events to its scrollback; a headless run renders them to plain ANSI
// on stdout; a future GUI/serve transport forwards them to a webview or
// websocket. This replaces the old io.Writer contract, where the agent wrote
// pre-formatted ANSI and the consumer had to re-derive structure by matching
// line prefixes — fragile, and lossy for any frontend richer than a terminal.
